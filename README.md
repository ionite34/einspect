## Check detailed states of built-in objects
```python
from einspect import view

ls = [1, 2, 3]
v = view(ls)
print(v.info())
```
```python
PyListObject(at 0x2833738):
   ob_refcnt: Py_ssize_t = 5
   ob_type: *PyTypeObject = &[list]
   ob_item: **PyObject = &[&[1], &[2], &[3]]
   allocated: Py_ssize_t = 4
```

[py_doc_mutable_seq]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mutable-sequence-types
## Mutate tuples, strings, ints, or other immutable types
> [TupleView][doc_tuple_view] and [StrView][doc_str_view] supports all [MutableSequence][py_doc_mutable_seq] methods (append, extend, insert, pop, remove, reverse, clear).
```python
from einspect import view

tup = (1, 2)
v = view(tup)

v[1] = 500
print(tup)      # (1, 500)
v.append(3)
print(tup)      # (1, 500, 3)

del v[:2]
print(tup)      # (3,)
print(v.pop())  # 3

v.extend([1, 2])
print(tup)      # (1, 2)

v.clear()
print(tup)      # ()
```
```python
from einspect import view

text = "hello"

v = view(text)
v[1] = "3"
v[4:] = "o~"
v.append("!")

print(text)  # h3llo~!
v.reverse()
print(text)  # !~oll3h
```
```python
from einspect import view

n = 500
view(n).value = 10

print(500)        # 10
print(500 == 10)  # True
```

## Modify attributes of built-in types, get original attributes with `orig`
```python
from einspect import view, orig

v = view(int)
v["__name__"] = "custom_int"
v["__iter__"] = lambda s: iter(range(s))
v["__repr__"] = lambda s: "custom: " + orig(int).__repr__(s)

print(int)
for i in 3:
    print(i)
```
```
<class 'custom_int'>
custom: 0
custom: 1
custom: 2
```

## Implement methods on built-in types
```python
from einspect import impl, orig

@impl(int)
def __add__(self, other):
    other = int(other)
    return orig(int).__add__(self, other)

print(50 + "25")  # 75
```

## Move objects in memory
```python
from einspect import view

s = "meaning of life"

v = view(s)
with v.unsafe():
    v <<= 42

print("meaning of life")        # 42
print("meaning of life" == 42)  # True
```

## Views

### Using the `einspect.view` constructor

This is the recommended and simplest way to create a `View` onto an object. Equivalent to constructing a specific `View` subtype from `einspect.views`, except the choice of subtype is automatic based on object type.

```python
from einspect import view

print(view(1))
print(view("hello"))
print(view([1, 2]))
print(view((1, 2)))
```
> ```
> IntView(<PyLongObject at 0x102058920>)
> StrView(<PyUnicodeObject at 0x100f12ab0>)
> ListView(<PyListObject at 0x10124f800>)
> TupleView(<PyTupleObject at 0x100f19a00>)
> ```

### Inspecting struct attributes

Attributes of the underlying C Struct of objects can be accessed through the view's properties.
```python
from einspect import view

ls = [1, 2]
v = view(ls)

# Inherited from PyObject
print(v.ref_count)  # ob_refcnt
print(v.type)       # ob_type
# Inherited from PyVarObject
print(v.size)       # ob_size
# From PyListObject
print(v.item)       # ob_item
print(v.allocated)  # allocated
```
> ```
> 4
> <class 'tuple'>
> 3
> <einspect.structs.c_long_Array_3 object at 0x105038ed0>
> ```

## 2. Writing to view attributes

Writing to these attributes will affect the underlying object of the view.

Note that most memory-unsafe attribute modifications require entering an unsafe context manager with `View.unsafe()`
```python
with v.unsafe():
    v.size -= 1

print(obj)
```
> `(1, 2)`

Since `items` is an array of integer pointers to python objects, they can be replaced by `id()` addresses to modify
index items in the tuple.
```python
from einspect import view

tup = (100, 200)

with view(tup).unsafe() as v:
    s = "dog"
    v.item[0] = id(s)

print(tup)
```
> ```
> ('dog', 200)
>
> >> Process finished with exit code 139 (interrupted by signal 11: SIGSEGV)
> ```

So here we did set the item at index 0 with our new item, the string `"dog"`, but this also caused a segmentation fault.
Note that the act of setting an item in containers like tuples and lists "steals" a reference to the object, even
if we only supplied the address pointer.

To make this safe, we will have to manually increment a ref-count before the new item is assigned. To do this we can
either create a `view` of our new item, and increment its `ref_count += 1`, or use the apis from `einspect.api`, which
are pre-typed implementations of `ctypes.pythonapi` methods.
```python
from einspect import view
from einspect.api import Py

tup = (100, 200)

with view(tup).unsafe() as v:
    a = "bird"
    Py.IncRef(a)
    v.item[0] = id(a)

    b = "kitten"
    Py.IncRef(b)
    v.item[1] = id(b)

print(tup)
```
> `('bird', 'kitten')`

🎉 No more seg-faults, and we just successfully set both items in an otherwise immutable tuple.

To make the above routine easier, you can access an abstraction by simply indexing the view.

```python
from einspect import view

tup = ("a", "b", "c")

v = view(tup)
v[0] = 123
v[1] = "hm"
v[2] = "🤔"

print(tup)
```
> `(123, 'hm', '🤔')`
